# Initiative: Draft Initial Project Documentation to Establish a Well-Defined Project Scope

## Description

The initiative aims to create preliminary project documentation that outlines a
clear and comprehensive project scope.

## Goals

- To establish a precise understanding of the project scope
- To provide a clear direction for the project team

## Scope

The initiative will cover the following areas:

- Project goals and objectives
- Project requirements and constraints
- Stakeholder identification and engagement
- Project timeline and budget

## Outcomes

The expected outcomes of the initiative include:

- A well-defined project scope
- Increased clarity and understanding among team members
- Improved project planning and execution

## Deliverables

- Project scope statement
- Stakeholder engagement plan

## Milestones

- Finalization of project scope statement
- Completion of stakeholder engagement plan

## Constraints

The main constraint for this project is that there will be limited time since it
is a semester long project. Another constraint is the limited budget and
resources may impact the scope and timeline of the initiative.

## Assumptions

It is assumed that the project will adhere to agile and scrum methodologies
where the stakeholders are constantly engaged and monitor the development of the
project (as well as the initial stages such as this documentation).

## Risks

In this project, the most significant risk is the potential for changes in
requirements during development. If such changes are substantial, they could
significantly alter the project's direction. Therefore, the extensive planning
and documentation provided in this initiative are designed to mitigate this risk
and ensure that the project remains on track.

## Dependencies

The initiative is dependent on the availability and participation of key
stakeholders.

## Team

- Project Manager: Responsible for overall project management and coordination
- Business and Developer Analysts: Responsible for requirements gathering and
  documentation
- Stakeholder Engagement Lead: Responsible for stakeholder identification and
  engagement
