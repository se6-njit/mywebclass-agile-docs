# Incorporating Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery

## Description

This epic aims to incorporate Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
practices into our software development process to improve efficiency and
productivity.

## Goals

- Reduce time to market for new software releases
- Improve software quality and reliability
- Enhance collaboration and communication between development and operations
  teams

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to automate the build process to reduce errors and save
  time.
- As a tester, I want to automate the testing process to ensure consistent and
  reliable results.
- As a release manager, I want to automate the deployment process to reduce
  downtime and improve the user experience.
- As an operations engineer, I want to monitor the software continuously to
  detect and resolve issues quickly.

## Dependencies

- Availability of necessary infrastructure and tools, such as a build server,
  testing framework, and deployment pipeline.
- Adequate resources and training to implement CI/CD practices effectively.

## Risks

- Resistance to change from stakeholders and team members
- Technical difficulties in implementing CI/CD workflows
- Integration challenges with legacy systems

## Mitigation strategies

- Communicate the benefits of CI/CD practices to stakeholders and team members
- Provide training and support to team members on DevOps practices
- Conduct thorough testing and quality assurance to identify and mitigate
  technical difficulties and integration challenges

## Estimated Effort

50-100 story points

## Business Value

- Faster time to market for new software releases
- Improved software quality and reliability
- Enhanced collaboration and communication between development and operations
  teams

## Priority

High
