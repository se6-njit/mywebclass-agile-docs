# Implement a Continuous Integration Tool

## Description

As a software developer, I want to implement a Continuous Integration (CI) tool
in our development process so that we can automate the build and testing of our
code and detect errors more quickly.

<!-- 3. Incomplete user story - there is no acceptance criteria. COMPLETED -->

## Acceptance Criteria

- The CI tool is integrated into our development process and automatically
  builds and tests code changes on a regular basis.
- The tool provides notifications to developers when errors are detected,
  allowing them to fix issues quickly.
- The CI tool is configured to work with our code repository and can build and
  test all code branches.
- The tool's performance is monitored and optimized as necessary to ensure it
  runs smoothly and efficiently.
- Documentation is created to outline the use of the CI tool and its
  configuration.
