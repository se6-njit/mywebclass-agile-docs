# Integrating Bamboo into our project

## User Story

[Implement an Continuous Integration Tool]()

## Description

This task involves integrating Bamboo into our project and configuring it to
automate our build and deployment processes. Specifically, we need to:

- Install and configure Bamboo on our build server
- Create a build plan that specifies the steps needed to build our code
- Configure Bamboo to automatically trigger builds when changes are pushed to
  our code repository
- Set up deployment tasks to deploy our code to testing and production
  environments

## Acceptance Criteria

- Bamboo is successfully installed and configured on our build server
- A build plan is created that specifies the steps needed to build our code
- Bamboo is configured to automatically trigger builds when changes are pushed
  to our code repository
- Deployment tasks are set up to deploy our code to testing and production
  environments
- All builds and deployments are successful and result in a functioning
  application
- Documentation is created to outline the use of Bamboo and its configuration in
  our development workflow
