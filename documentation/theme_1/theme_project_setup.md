# Theme 1.0: Developing a Website - mywebclass.org Project

## Overview

Our goal is to create a prominent and noticeable online presence by utilizing
lean and agile methodologies to develop a robust foundation for our web project.
We aim to complete the various initiatives outlined in this theme to establish a
strong foundation that guarantees our website satisfies our business
requirements for the entirety of the project's lifespan, ultimately positioning
us for long-term success.

To achieve our objective, we will employ lean principles, which emphasize the
elimination of waste in our development process, allowing us to focus on
essential features that align with our business goals. Additionally, we will
utilize agile methodologies, which enable us to work in an iterative and
incremental fashion, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in response to
feedback and changes in requirements. By implementing these principles, we aim
to create a web presence that is not only highly visible but also functional and
user-friendly, providing an exceptional experience for our target audience. Our
strong foundation will allow us to build upon our initial efforts, continually
enhancing and refining our website to meet our evolving business needs and
customer demands.

This approach to developing a highly visible web presence using lean and agile
principles is focused on establishing a strong foundation that supports our
long-term success. Through our commitment to efficiency, flexibility, and
customer satisfaction, we are confident in our ability to create a website that
aligns with our business goals and delivers value to our customers.
